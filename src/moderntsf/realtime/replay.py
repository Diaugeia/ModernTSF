"""Replay the rolling protocol over historical weeks.

Each replayed round is opened at a past weekly cutoff on a store that already
contains the following weeks, forecast by baselines (and optionally catalog
models trained only on data up to that cutoff), and scored immediately. The
rounds are written to a separate root so they never mix with live rounds.
