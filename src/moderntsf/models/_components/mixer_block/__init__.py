"""Canonical TSMixer-style time/feature residual mixing block.

Extracted verbatim (structure and attribute names unchanged) from the basic
TSMixer implementation (paper Appendix B.3.2): pre-normalized residual time
mixing over the sequence axis followed by a pre-normalized residual two-layer
feature (channel) mixer. Reuse this block only where a consumer's mixing
order, normalization shape, and residual placement are exactly this one;
paper-specific factorizations (subsequence mixers, low-rank channel
bottlenecks, post-norm ordering, additional hidden layers, etc.) must stay
model-local instead of being forced through this contract.
