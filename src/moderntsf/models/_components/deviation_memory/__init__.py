"""Learnable prototype memory bank with attention retrieval and a
paper-neutral deviation score between two representations.

Implements a small self-supervised "normal pattern" memory: a bank of ``M``
learnable prototype vectors that any encoder's hidden representation can be
compared against. Given a representation ``h`` of shape ``(..., query_dim)``,
:class:`PrototypeMemory` projects it to a query, attends softly over every
prototype to retrieve a blended value, and additionally reports the single
nearest and second-nearest prototype (by attention score) so a caller can
build a triplet/contrastive objective that pulls representations toward one
prototype and away from a distractor:

    query = h @ Wq                                   # (..., d)
    score = softmax(query @ prototypes^T, dim=-1)     # (..., M)
    value = score @ prototypes                        # (..., d) soft retrieval
    nearest, second_nearest = top-2 prototypes by score

:func:`deviation_score` then reduces any two same-shaped representations
(typically a "current" and a "reference/historical" query or nearest-prototype
pair) to a non-negative scalar per row via mean absolute difference, giving a
generic self-supervised deviation signal: how different the current pattern's
retrieval is from a reference one. Neither piece is spatiotemporal-specific —
``h`` may carry a node axis, a plain batch axis, or any other leading shape —
so this composes with graph forecasters and ordinary sequence forecasters
alike that want an auxiliary "how different from the past" signal.
