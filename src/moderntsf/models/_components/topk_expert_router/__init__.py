"""Gated top-k expert routing shared by DUET-style and DynamicTMoE-style mixtures.

Two paper-neutral pieces are extracted here:

- ``GatingMLP`` reproduces a two-layer ``Linear -> GELU -> Linear`` gate with an
  optional trainable-noise term added to the logits before softmax during
  training. This is the exact gate DUET's ``DistributionalRouter`` used.
- ``topk_dense_mix`` reproduces the "zero outside top-k, blend in a floor of
  the dense weights, renormalize" sparsification shared by DUET's post-router
  mixing step and DynamicTMoE's ``routing_weights`` concentration step. Both
  models compute dense softmax weights, zero every non-selected expert, add a
  small floor fraction of the dense weights back in (to keep every expert's
  gradient alive), and renormalize so the weights sum to one.
