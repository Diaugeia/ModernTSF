"""WaveNet-style causal dilated gated activation unit.

This module extracts the paper-neutral primitive shared by dilated
convolutional spatiotemporal forecasters: left (causal) padding sized to the
convolution's dilation and kernel width, followed by
``tanh(filter(x)) * sigmoid(gate(x))``. Graph mixing, residual and skip
connections, and any post-gate normalization stay model-local because they
vary per paper.
