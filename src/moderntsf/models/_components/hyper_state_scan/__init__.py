"""Kernel-free scalar-state selective scan and a 2-D grid state mixer.

Some Mamba-style forecasters use a *scalar* per-channel state (one decay per
channel rather than a bank of ``d_state`` states) and then spatially mix that
state across a 2-D grid of positions -- for example a (time-patch, variate)
grid -- before it is read out. This module isolates those two paper-neutral
pieces:

* :func:`diagonal_selective_scan` runs the sequential recurrence
  ``h_t = exp(delta_t * A) * h_{t-1} + delta_t * B_t * u_t`` without any
  CUDA-only kernel, mirroring the portability contract of
  ``moderntsf.models._components.mamba`` but for the degenerate ``d_state == 1`` case
  and without folding the ``C`` read-out or ``D`` skip into the scan, so a
  caller can post-process the raw state before reading it out.
* :class:`GridStateMixer` propagates that state across a 2-D grid with a
  depthwise convolution. It is a portable stand-in for offset-based
  deformable convolutions (for example DCNv4), which require a custom CUDA
  kernel; using a fixed local receptive field keeps the same "mix a state
  with its spatial neighbors" semantics on CPU at the cost of the learned
  sampling offsets.
