"""Depth-indexed contiguous frequency-band selection over an FFT axis.

Several dual time-frequency architectures allocate different spectral bands to
different network depths so that shallow layers keep high-frequency detail and
deep layers specialize on low-frequency trend. This module provides that band
arithmetic as a paper-neutral operator, independent of any one model's encoder.
