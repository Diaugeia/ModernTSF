"""Typed contract for model-provided training objectives.

A model that needs a paper-specific loss declares it on ``ModelSpec`` as
``training_objective`` (and optionally ``training_setup``). The trainer calls it
only while training; validation, early stopping and test metrics always use the
configured observation criterion on ``forward`` outputs. Models that declare
nothing train exactly as before (configured criterion plus the optional
``aux_loss`` regularizer).
