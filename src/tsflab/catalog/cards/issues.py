"""Upstream issues: problems found in a model's paper or official code.

Every model card carries a curated ``## Upstream issues`` section before the
canonical block. It is the structured record of what independent
reimplementation exposed, separate from ``Differences`` (which also lists
TSFLab's own scoping choices). One bullet per issue, on one line:

    - **code-bug** · `model/diffusion.py`: noise is `randint_like(x, 0, 1)`, all zeros, so nothing is diffused. Resolution: Gaussian noise per Eq. 2-6.

``<kind>`` is one of :data:`KINDS`; the location names a file (at the pinned
revision), an equation, section, table, or script; ``Resolution:`` says what
TSFLab does instead. A card with nothing to report says so explicitly:

    None found: <what was checked, e.g. Eq. 1-9 against `models/x.py`>.
