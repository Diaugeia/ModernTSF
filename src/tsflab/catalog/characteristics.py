"""One vocabulary of data and task characteristics shared by every card.

Datasets declare the characteristics they have (`characteristics` in the dataset
card, measured by `tsf data analyze <preset> --write-card`); models and
components declare the characteristics they are designed for (`fits` in their
cards). `tsf catalog match <preset>` intersects the two so research starts from
what the data needs rather than from names.

Three kinds of terms:

* ``data`` terms are measurable. Each is one rule of
  ``src/tsflab/data/profile_rules.toml`` (metric, comparison, threshold, finding);
  that file stays the single source of thresholds.
* ``task`` terms describe the forecasting setup and come from the dataset preset
  and loader (graph inputs, timestamps, covariates, horizon, output type).
* ``any`` marks a generic building block with no data-specific benefit.
