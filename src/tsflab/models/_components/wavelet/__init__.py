"""Fixed-filter discrete wavelet analysis and synthesis for BCL tensors.

Two paper-neutral transforms, both channel-independent (grouped convolution)
over ``(batch, channels, length)`` tensors:

- :class:`DecimatedWaveletTransform` -- critically sampled (stride-2),
  multi-level orthogonal wavelet decomposition, with an exact linear inverse
  for two-tap orthonormal filters (``haar``/``db1``).
- :class:`UndecimatedWaveletTransform` -- a-trous (dilated, stride-1)
  stationary wavelet decomposition that keeps the sequence length fixed at
  every level, appropriate when downstream code needs aligned per-timestep
  subbands.

Filter taps are the closed-form (``haar``/``db2``) or standard tabulated
(``db4``) orthonormal Daubechies coefficients; these are independently
derivable mathematical constants, entered here directly rather than sourced
from any external package's implementation.

    ``trims`` all flags are zero, which is exact only for coefficients whose
