"""Learnable node-embedding adaptive adjacency: ``softmax(relu(E1 @ E2^T))``.

This is the dense, self-normalizing adaptive graph used by several
spatiotemporal forecasters to complement predefined or dynamic supports. It
covers both the dual embedding form (independent source/target parameters)
and the single self-similarity form (one embedding compared against its own
transpose); the pairwise scoring, ``relu``, and row-wise ``softmax`` are
identical in both cases. Any Chebyshev or other polynomial basis built on top
of the resulting adjacency is paper-specific and stays model-local.
