class SharedSparseConnectionRouter(nn.Module):
    """Learn a shared 0/1 connection matrix over ``num_positions`` positions.

    The matrix is derived from an internal learnable memory table rather than
    from the input batch, so it is shared across every sample and channel that
    consumes it (one matrix per head). At each call the router:

    1. encodes a per-position, per-head memory embedding through a small
       stacked-linear encoder;
    2. scores every ordered pair of positions ``(i, j)`` with a shared
       two-layer MLP over the concatenated pair embeddings;
    3. turns the pair scores into connection probabilities and enforces a
       fixed target density by keeping only the top ``density`` fraction of
       scores per head, using a straight-through estimator so gradients still
       flow to the memory/encoder/scorer parameters through the dense scores.

    During training, standard-Gumbel noise is added to the scores before
    thresholding so the discrete selection explores neighbouring connections
    instead of collapsing deterministically; at evaluation the noise is
    disabled and the router is a deterministic function of its learned
    parameters (it does not depend on ``x`` at all).

    This is a paper-neutral building block for models that mix a fixed number
    of tokens/positions (e.g. patches) through a learned, sparse, sample- and
    channel-shared adjacency instead of a dense (self-attention style) one.
