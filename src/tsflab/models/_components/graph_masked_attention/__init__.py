"""Multi-head attention blending a global dense score matrix with a local
adjacency-masked score matrix.

Implements a node-attention layer that lets learned, data-driven affinity and
a fixed graph adjacency structure shape attention jointly instead of
exclusively. Given queries/keys/values over a node (or any token) axis, this
module computes standard scaled dot-product multi-head attention scores once,
then takes softmax twice from those same raw scores: densely over every token
pair ("global") and, when an ``adj_mask`` is supplied, only over
adjacency-permitted pairs via additive ``-inf`` masking before softmax
("local"). The two probability matrices are averaged before being applied to
``value``:

    scores = (query @ key.transpose(-1, -2)) / sqrt(head_dim)
    global_attn = softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    local_attn  = softmax(scores.masked_fill(~adj_mask, -inf), dim=-1)
    attn = (global_attn + local_attn) / 2  # when adj_mask is given
    out  = attn @ value

When ``adj_mask`` is ``None`` the local term is skipped and this reduces to
plain multi-head self-/cross-attention. This is the paper equation
``GLSAtt = (Softmax(alpha_local) + Softmax(alpha_global)) @ V / 2`` used by
Extralonger's spatial-attention route, generalized so any graph forecaster
that wants to bias full attention with a fixed adjacency (without discarding
long-range, data-driven affinity entirely) can reuse it.
