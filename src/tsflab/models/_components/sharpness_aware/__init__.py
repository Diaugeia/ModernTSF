"""First-order sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) as a training-loss wrapper.

SAM (Foret et al., ICLR 2021) minimizes the loss at the worst-case weights in a
rho-ball: ``w_adv = w + rho * g / ||g||`` with ``g = grad L(w)``; the optimizer
then steps ``w`` with ``grad L(w_adv)``. Because the gradient at ``w_adv`` is
what the base optimizer applies to ``w``, the update is reproduced by an
ordinary loss whose parameters are evaluated at the detached perturbation.
:func:`sharpness_aware_loss` returns exactly that loss, so any optimizer and the
standard ``loss.backward(); optimizer.step()`` loop implement SAM.
