"""Local PRISM: a binary time tree of overlapping segments with routed Haar bands.

Paper map (Chen et al., arXiv 2512.24898, Section 3.2 and Fig. 1): per-series
z-normalization; recursive bisection of the context into two overlapping halves
(the time hierarchy); a same-length Haar band decomposition of every segment (the
frequency hierarchy, K bands); a band router that scores six summary statistics of
each band with a two-layer MLP and turns the scores into weights with a
temperature softmax; the band-weighted sum of each half feeds the next level;
per-band two-layer MLP heads map every routed band to the horizon, a
squeeze-and-excitation gate reweights the band forecasts, and their sum is
de-normalized.

The pinned official code (nerdslab/PRISM, ``src/arch/prism.py``) fixes the
details the paper leaves open; see the model card for the full mapping.
