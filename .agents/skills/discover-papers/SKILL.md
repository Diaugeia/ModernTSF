description: "Discover, deduplicate, rank, and optionally expand the catalog with new time-series forecasting papers. Use for arXiv or Hugging Face paper scans, recurring literature monitoring, candidate-model intake, and an authorized search-to-model expansion run; not for implementing one approved paper (add-model) or reproducing a paper's results (reproduce-paper-results)."

# Discover forecasting papers

Models module, entry point: find new forecasting methods, deduplicate them against
the catalog, and return a ranked, source-linked queue. Search relevance is never permission or evidence to
add an implementation. Read [references/intake.md](references/intake.md) before
scanning or dispatching.

## Inputs

- A time window and optional focus (task, architecture, data regime).
- The deduplication baseline: `uv run tsf catalog list --kind model --json` (paper URLs, titles,
  public names from the model cards).

## Steps

1. Search both arXiv and Hugging Face Papers across the query lattice in the
   reference rather than one broad phrase; prefer source metadata and primary
   paper or project pages over snippets.
2. Normalize arXiv identifiers and titles, collapse cross-source duplicates, and
   reject papers that do not forecast future time-series values (evaluation-only,
   explanation, or out-of-scope tasks such as irregular series).
3. Rank by task relevance, novelty against the flat catalog, authoritative code
   availability, recency, and implementability. A missing official license does
   not disqualify a paper; record it so the implementation is an independent rewrite.
4. Write one brief per retained paper, separating verified facts from inference.

## Chain

- Module: Models.
- Reads: `tsf catalog list --kind model --json` and model cards at L0 for deduplication.
- Produces: a ranked, source-linked candidate queue (paper, code, license facts).
- Hands off to: `add-model` or `integrate-foundation-model` (one approved paper each).

## Success

- A ranked queue with primary URLs, deduplication results, and code facts; an
  empty queue with the scan recorded is a successful monitoring result.

## Stop and hand off

- Expansion (search through admission, bounded by a model budget) follows
  [references/expansion.md](references/expansion.md), only when authorized.
- Dispatch only when the user or recurring prompt explicitly asks: at most three
  independent tasks per run, one paper each, carrying the brief, URLs,
  deduplication result, deliverable, and the instruction to use `add-model` after
  paper, source, and runtime inputs are resolved. Dispatched tasks never merge,
  publish, or modify external systems.
- Implementation belongs to `add-model`; search results never establish a local
  implementation.
