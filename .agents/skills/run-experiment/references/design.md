# Design an experiment

Turn a research question into validated run configs and a design table without
spending compute. Design in the current Agent; no design command is required.

1. State the question and a falsifiable comparison first.
2. Resolve task mode, datasets and splits, representative horizons, primary and
   secondary metrics, strong baselines, controlled variables, seeds, resource budget,
   and failure or stopping criteria. Separate required comparisons from optional
   scale-up runs.
3. Encode shared settings by inheritance: a short run file that extends `base.toml`,
   one dataset preset, and one model preset (or `tsflab://configs/...` in a
   standalone project). Override only scientific variables under `experiment`,
   `task`, `training`, `model.params`, and `evaluation`; use `[sweep]` only for
   intended axes. The loader rejects unknown structural keys.
   Set data-dependent parameters from the model card's `[data_params]` (period,
   frequency, channels, nodes, seq_len, pred_len, graph, train-split) and the dataset
   profile; other hyperparameters keep preset defaults or form a small, budgeted grid.
4. Keep ablations one factor at a time unless interactions are the question. Match
   preprocessing, training budget, evaluation strategy, and metric direction across
   models; disclose unavoidable capability differences.
5. Verify the resolved matrix, run count, and parameter variation through the config
   loader and preflight (`uv run tsf run <run.toml> --dry-run --json`).

Deliverable: config paths plus a compact table of hypothesis, control, treatment,
datasets, horizons, metrics, seeds, estimated runs, and acceptance criteria. Do not
launch costly runs unless requested. Matching a published table belongs to
`reproduce-paper-results`.
